# Sorting-Algorithms
Various sorting algorithms, coded for self learning by doing.

Steps of my self learning:
# I first studied the basic concept of each algorithm from the book. Most often it felt pretty opeque.
# So for ease I watched various YouTube videos to get the conceptual understanding.
# After it felt like I've understood the concept, I tried to summerise the concept in code form my Algorith note book.
# Then I consulted the pseudocode given in book or codes given by other github users(links bellow).
# After modifying my code "rough", I took a small array of number and manually followed the steps of the algorithm on my khata (note-book). I call this "Walking the Algorithm" or "Manual Walking". Oftern this step produces the greatest conceptual understanding and revealed many small mistakes.
# Once manual walking is done, I typed, compiled and ran the code for final testing. This final testing step often revealed many more bugs and refined my understanding of the algorithm even further.
# As my study progressed I became aware of the bugs and more and more bugs are caught in the manual walking step.
# Finally when I combined all the algorithms to compile under signle umbrella program, the compilation completed with no compile error!
