# Sorting-Algorithms
Various sorting algorithms, coded for self learning by doing.

Steps of my self learning:
a) I first studied the basic concept of each algorithm from the book. Most often it felt pretty opeque.
b) So for ease I watched various YouTube videos to get the conceptual understanding.
c) After it felt like I've understood the concept, I tried to summerise the concept in code form my Algorith note book.
d) Then I consulted the pseudocode given in book or codes given by other github users(links bellow).
e) After modifying my code "rough", I took a small array of number and manually followed the steps of the algorithm on my khata (note-book). I call this "Walking the Algorithm" or "Manual Walking". Oftern this step produces the greatest conceptual understanding and revealed many small mistakes.
f) Once manual walking is done, I typed, compiled and ran the code for final testing. This final testing step often revealed many more bugs and refined my understanding of the algorithm even further.
g) As my study progressed I became aware of the bugs and more and more bugs are caught in the manual walking step.
h) Finally when I combined all the algorithms to compile under signle umbrella program, the compilation completed with no compilation error!
